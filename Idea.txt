Create trading bot using market sentiment

gets sentiment from twitter and needs something to get sentiment from a more professional set of
users potentionaly lse forums but there are other social media that is better.

finds shares with poitve sentiment to invest in then sells when sentiment lowers better to do
through cahnge in sentiment rather than actual value as this will have a greater effect on price fluctaions
rather than price.

Hopefully market sentiment through professional social media will see when the market is going to turn
before it does so ican optimise selling point and also oppourtunities where professional and
casual sentiment differ so much.

--- FACTORS ---
Size = smaller companies tend to have higher returns but this comes with added risk this should be taken into
account when deciding how good the opurtunity is. if a small company has the same variation in the expected
price as a large company then the large company is the same opurtunity with lower risk

Value = value of price to earnings. price per earnings lower price per earning ussualy means you are getting 
a good deal more bang for your buck. where as companies which have a high price per earnings often have high 
growth or growth expectations circa 85% of stocks with this do have high growth in the future.

Quality = high and stable earnings such as coca cola or walmart have high quality as they have highly 
profitable and stable earnings.

Momentum = momentum are stocks that have done well over the past 6-12 mounths. companies that have 
performed well in the last month tend not to do as well. price momentum stocks performing well. postive price
momentum has a much larger effect than negtive price momentum
